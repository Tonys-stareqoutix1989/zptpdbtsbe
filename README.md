Just came out of that Dual  , you know the one. Theater was way too loud, or maybe that was just my head. Popcorn bits still stuck in my hoodie — I swear they should make popcorn-resistant clothes. But oh boy, things were happening on that screen, trying to wrap my brain around it. Can’t even tell if my backache is from the weird chair or the existential dread of having a clone take over my life. 

So there’s this woman, right, and she gets copied, like photocopied but in a human way. And then! They tell her she has to fight for her own life. It’s like if your reflection just stepped out of the mirror and said, Yeah, I've had enough of just reflecting. Gimme living rights. Trippy. 

The pacing was odd, like someone spilled molasses over the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 reel. But the moments, man, some of them hit hard, like when you’re 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a vending machine snatch your dollar and you just know it's not coming back. One scene, uh, was it a woods scene? Yeah, the woods, dark and brooding, it made me feel like I could reach out and touch the damp bark, y’know? Or was it the air con in there? 

> Director had this way of making every pause feel like the moment before you sneeze. Building you up for the aaaah, then leaving you no choo. Oh, Sarah and her double were like cats in a bag, y'know? Cat fight in there, but all cerebral, like chess but without the board, just the mental checkmates. I think someone asked about if you could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or like, if there’s a 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 where you could just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   at home. 

Dialogues though... crispy, like an apple but you take it all in with your eyes instead. Characters, two of them were one but not really, I'm still untangling that. Not just a sci-fi, but a kind of awkward life seminar, makes you think if the clone would also worry about odd theater chairs. 

Was I the only one thinking the ending was like a donut hole, promising something sweet but just empty inside?
